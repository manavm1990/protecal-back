# TypeScript Starter

Uses `"strict"` settings, includes `eslint`, `prettier`, the each and everything.

1. `npm run tsc` for `tsc -w`
2. In separate terminal window, `npm start` to have `nodemon` watch the built files. Runs with `node --experimental`.
3. If desired, in another terminal window, `npm test` to run `jest --watch`
